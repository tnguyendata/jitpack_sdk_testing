## END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT TERMS

This EULA (End User Software License Agreement) ("EULA" or "Agreement") is a legally binding agreement governing the licensing of the Software and Documentation by Datalogic IP Tech S.r.l. and its subsidiaries and Affiliates ("Datalogic") to the entity or person who has purchased or otherwise acquired a Datalogic Product ("End User"). For purposes of this Agreement, any software that is not the Datalogic SDK, Embedded Software or Application Software is software associated with a separate end-user license agreement and is licensed to you under the terms of that license agreement. Software is provided only for use in support of the Datalogic Product and any other use of Software is strictly prohibited and may subject you to legal action. Software is provided to you under license, subject to the terms and conditions of this EULA. Any and all updates to Software shall also be subject to this EULA. If you use a Datalogic Product that includes the Software or by downloading, the Datalogic SDK, you will be deemed to have accepted the terms and conditions of this EULA. If you do not intend to be bound to the terms of this EULA, Datalogic is not willing to license the Software to you; and you may not use the Datalogic Product or download, install or use the Software; and you must contact the party from whom you acquired the Datalogic Product for instructions on how to return the Datalogic Product.

Datalogic and End User hereby agree as follows:

## 2. Scope of License Granted

**2.1** Datalogic grants to End User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, perpetual license to use the Software, solely in support of the Datalogic Product in which it is embedded, or the product for which it is intended for use ("designated Datalogic Product"), in machine-readable form only, solely for End User's internal business purposes. This Agreement does not convey ownership of the Software to End User. Title to the Software shall be and remain with Datalogic or the third party from whom Datalogic has obtained a licensed right. As used in this Agreement, the term "purchase" or its equivalents when applied to the Software shall mean "acquire under license."

**2.2** End User shall not copy, modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise reproduce or remanufacture the Software, whether modified or unmodified, nor sell, assign, sublicense, distribute, lend, rent, give, or otherwise transfer the Software to any other person or organization, for purposes other than as expressly provided in this Agreement, without Datalogic's prior written consent.

## 3. Transfers, Support

**3.1** Any copying, installing, reproduction, remanufacture, reverse engineering, electronic transfer, mimicking, or other use of the Software in support of any other product other than the designated Datalogic Product will be a material breach of this Agreement. However, Datalogic may elect not to terminate this Agreement or the granted licenses, but instead may elect to notify End User that End User is deemed to have ordered and accepted a license for each breaching use on qualified Datalogic Products. End User shall pay Datalogic the applicable list price for such licenses as of the date of such breach.

**3.2** End User shall not sell, assign, sublicense, distribute, lend, rent, give, or otherwise transfer the Datalogic Product to any third party unless such third party agrees with Datalogic in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such transfer of the Datalogic Product absent such agreement shall be null and void.

**3.3** End User may obtain support for Software from Datalogic at Datalogic's standard support fees and under Datalogic's standard support terms and conditions in effect at the time the support is requested.

## 4. Intellectual Property

End User acknowledges that the Software constitutes valuable trade secrets of Datalogic or Datalogic's third party licensors and that the Software is protected by United States copyright law and trade secret law, and by all applicable international intellectual property laws and treaty provisions. The license set forth in this Agreement does not transfer to End User any ownership of Datalogic's or its third-party licensors' copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights and End User shall have no right to commence any legal actions to obtain such rights. End User shall not remove, modify, or take any other action that would obscure any copyright, trademark, patent marking, or other intellectual property notices contained in or on the Software or the Datalogic Product.

**5.2** End User shall not disclose, provide, or otherwise make available the Proprietary Information of Datalogic or its third-party licensors to any person other than End User's authorized employees or agents who are under confidentiality agreement, and End User shall not use the Proprietary Information other than in conjunction with use of the Datalogic Product exclusively for End User's internal business purposes. End User shall take steps to protect the Proprietary Information no less securely than if it were End User's own intellectual property.

**5.3** The provisions of this Proprietary Information Section shall survive and continue for five (5) years after the termination of this Agreement, or for trade secrets, as long as allowed by applicable law.

## 6. Limited Warranty

**6.1** Datalogic warrants that, under normal use and operation, the Software will conform substantially to the applicable Documentation for the period specified in the Documentation. During this period, for all reproducible nonconformities for which Datalogic has been given written notice, Datalogic will use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy nonconformities verified by Datalogic. End User agrees to supply Datalogic with all reasonably requested information and assistance necessary to help Datalogic in remedying such nonconformities. For all defects reported to Datalogic within the warranty period, Datalogic's liability is limited to providing End User with one copy of corrections or responding to End User's problem reports according to Datalogic's standard assistance practices. Datalogic does not warrant that Software will meet End User's requirements or that use of Software will be uninterrupted or error free, or that Datalogic's remedial efforts will correct any nonconformance. End User agrees that the existence of such nonconformities or errors and Datalogic's inability to remedy such errors shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement. This limited warranty does not cover use of the Software with any hardware system other than the Datalogic Product or to Software that has been subjected to damage or abuse, whether intentionally, accidentally, or by neglect, or to unauthorized repair or unauthorized installation, and shall be void if End User alters or modifies the Datalogic Product or Software, uses the Datalogic Product or Software in any manner other than as established in the Documentation, or if End User breaches any of the provisions of this Agreement.

**6.2** EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE DATALOGIC PRODUCT AND SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND DATALOGIC AND ITS THIRD PARTY LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED (AT LAW OR IN EQUITY), WRITTEN OR ORAL, WITH RESPECT TO THE DATALOGIC PRODUCT OR SOFTWARE, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 7. Infringement

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the End User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Datalogic, its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, actions, suits or proceedings, as well as any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of or accruing from (a) the End User's use of the Datalogic SDK, (b) any application the End User develops on the Datalogic SDK that infringes any Intellectual Property Rights of any person or defames any person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any non-compliance by you of the License Agreement.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 7, NEITHER DATALOGIC NOR ITS LICENSORS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS AGAINST END USER BY ANY OTHER PARTY. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LIABILITY OF DATALOGIC AND/OR ITS LICENSORS FOR DAMAGES, IF ANY, WHETHER BASED UPON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EXCEED THE PRICE OR FEE PAID BY END USER FOR THE DATALOGIC PRODUCT. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL DATALOGIC OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE TO END USER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS OR SERVICE, OR FOR ANY OTHER SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, CONTINGENT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES, EVEN IF DATALOGIC OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
